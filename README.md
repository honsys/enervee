Amanda Olson Enervee (Silicon Beach!) interview "test"

Gmail downloaded as PDF onto my Linux desktop (currently Ubuntu Mint) and used pdftotext ...
But cutting and pasting some of the prose of the text file into Python source introduced
some 'mystery' text that confused the Python interpretor and required extra hand-edits!

The enervy.py scrit can be executed directly, or imported as a module for evalation, etc.
